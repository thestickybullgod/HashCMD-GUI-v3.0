SHA256 of HashCMD_GUI_v3.0.exe — 6c871260a37a5969e23b969b786f601aa09e1d52bbc75d75d05c422894632930

📜 HashCMD_GUI v3.0
Crafted by Dustin W. Deen
In collaborative ritual with Microsoft Copilot

A symbolic hashing interface that transforms cryptographic operations into poetic, time-stamped artifacts of clarity.

🧰 Features
- String & File hashing modes (SHA256, SHA1, SHA512, MD5, SHA384, RIPEMD160)
- HMAC support (HMACSHA256, HMACSHA512) with masked key input
- Scroll-style hash output with dynamic font sizing
- Timestamp footer refreshed per hash action or verdict
- Log viewer tab with optional logging toggle
- Auto-copy feature for generated hashes
- Compare hash verdicts (✅ MATCH, ❌ MISMATCH) with symbolic glyphs and color feedback
- Encrypted log handling architecture (expandable with vault logic)
- Clear log and clear output buttons for scroll management

💡 Philosophy
HashCMD_GUI isn’t just a tool — it’s a living artifact. Designed with symbolic clarity, every interaction is part of a mnemonic ritual. Font scaling and color feedback allow the user’s aesthetic intent to flow through each cryptographic seal. Tabs, toggles, and labels form a ceremonial space for hashing.

🔧 Requirements
